      <description>Today i had to fix a linux laptop, that did not boot correctly, and where i did not know the password of.
The graphical user interface did not came up because of a full ssd. This i did not know yet when i got the laptop. I figured that it would be easiest to login on the system to have easy access to journalctl etc.
So i created a user from a live linux CD called GRML.</description>

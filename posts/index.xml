      <description>I create wireguard configurations for ~120 users via a small nim application. Its easy and works beautifully on windows and macos with the official wireguard client for those platforms.
The same config, does not work on linux.
When enabled it basically broke my network.
The issue was that i added a whole subnet to the AllowedIPs that also contained the endpoint&amp;rsquo;s ip. Interestingly this worked on windows and macos but not on linux.</description>

      <description>I encountered an issue with wireguard vpn + grist + authentik sso via SAML.
When i want to login, the page hang. There where no signs of the request in the nginx servers logfiles nor in grist&amp;rsquo;s and authentik&amp;rsquo;s log output.
After a few hours (sic) of hunting, i found that the issue is the default MTU assigned by wg-quick being too large.
I tried a few MTU sizes and found that i had to lower it to 1403:</description>
